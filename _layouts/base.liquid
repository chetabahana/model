*
*  This loop loops through a collection called `feeds` with category 'section'
*  and sorts it by the front matter variable 'weight' and than render
*  each of the {{ output }} with their own layout
*
*  Difference between Section, Container and Div:
*  - Section: Has standard full width of viewport and cannot have nested sections
*  - Container: Same as Div but locked at 940 pixel width and auto-placed in center of page
*  - Div: Same as a container without restrictions and can have nested divs
*
*  To provide it with an online work you may see the running code here:
